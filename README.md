> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with
smart people at [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/).

## Usage

To auto-generate the README.md file, you can run
    ./create_readme.py > README.md

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../create_readme.py pre-commit && cd -
